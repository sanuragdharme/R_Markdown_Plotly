## Understanding Gas Mileage

Using the `mtcars` dataset we plotted, we can try to understand the relationship of factors to fuel consumption (`mpg`).

The weight (`wt`) versus the mileage (`mpg`) along the x/y axes. The number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors and the amount of power (`hp`) as the size of an individual point on the graph.

## Visualizing the MTCar Data:

```{r plot, warning = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(
  data  = mtcars,
  x     = ~wt,
  y     = ~mpg,
  color = ~as.factor(cyl),
  size  = ~hp,
  text  = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
  type  = "scatter",
  mode  = "markers"
) %>%
  layout(title = "MTCar Data")
```
